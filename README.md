# COREI

## About me

My name is Luis Manuel Lozano Castro and I had my first interaction with a programming language in 2016; in short, it was a blast.
I decided that I wanted to change careers and study to become a developer. In 2019 the opportunity to be part of an intensive web development bootcamp at Ironhack presented itself. I was selected to be part of the bootcamp starting in January 2020, so I left it all behind and came here to Mexico city to change my life.

## How did COREI came to be and what is it?

I study law and I exercised the profession for nine years. In this time, I had to defend many clients from people or businesses that with whom they had signed contracts to publish their properties to rent or to sell. This contracts demanded from my clients exclusivity for a long period of time; meaning they could not advertise their property in any other place and huge commissions.

Aside this, I see that many people go to facebook to publish their properties to rent or to sell, meaning there is a lack of a good place for people to post their properties for this purposes.

So that's how COREI came to be.
COREI means Compra Renta Inmueble which in english translates to Buy Rent Property.  

## What is COREI?

It is a platform where people can, freely, without any commissions or contracts publish their properties to sell or rent and find all the properties that have been posted in this sections.

## How does it work?

Just create an account and you can browse the sections of rent or buy, click any of them to see the extended details of the property.  
If you want to publish, go to the publish section, fill all the required inputs and upload your image.

## How to run it.

Fork the repository, clone it and install all the dependencies running npm i in your terminal.
